    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <ul>
      <h3>Thinking Like a Programmer</h3>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <p>
            <h4>1. Procedural Thinking</h4>
            <ul>
              Procedural thinking means being able to craft clear and precise
              instructions that a computer can follow, lacking ambiguity and very
              detailed.
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <h4>2. Abstract Thinking</h4>
            <ul>
              Abstract thinking is having the ability to find a similarity between
              things that may seem very different. This is basically like finding
              the "least common denominator" between the two things.<br>
              <br>
              This is really important because it allows programmers to design
              things to be reused, so that they can repeat that effort thousands
              of times over.
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <h4>3. Systems Thinking</h4>
            <ul>
              Systems thinking is the ability to break a big problem down into
              smaller chunks. This is important in programming because it allows
              the programmer to think of the big-picture and to come up with a
              roadmap to completion.
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <h4>4. Technological Empathy</h4>
            <ul>
              Technological Empathy is the same thing as empathizing with another
              human. It's understanding how the computer works and what its strengths
              and weaknesses are. <b>This allows the programmer to make the right design
              choices when it comes time to decide what the computer should do
              <em>(math)</em> and what the computer should not do <em>(decide who
              lives)</em>.</b>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <h4>5. Debugging</h4>
            <ul>
              Debugging is a process of finding and resolving issues with programs.
              Even the best programmers make mistakes, so it is important to be
              able to identify and resolve these bugs as they arise.
            </ul>
          </p>
        </ul>

        <h3>Orientation</h3>
        <ul>
          <h4>Projects and Progress</h4>
          <ul>
            You will be graded based on a series of milestones, most of which will
            take the form of projects. You can prepare for these projects by taking
            your courses, although <b>reviewing all of the course material isn't a
            graduation requirement</b>. If you've come in with a ton of prior experience,
            feel free jumping right into the projects.
          </ul>

        <h3>Computers Are Stupid</h3>
        <ul>
          <b>Humans create sentences which are designed for <em>other</em> humans to
          understand.</b> They are lacking structure and make lots of assumptions
          that other humans can interpret. Computers can't fill in these assumptions
          and require a very structured language which gives them very detailed
          instructions on what to do.
        </ul>
      </p>


      <p>
      <h3>It's OK to Forget</h3>
        <ul>
          New programmers often struggle with trying to remember <em>everything</em>
          because in other learning environments you have to remember a lot of facts.
          Programming doesn't work like that, there's just <em>too much</em> to
          remember. The important thing is to be able to remember the big ideas, and
          know how to find the details that you need as you need them.
        </ul>
      </p>

      <p>
      <h3>Block Elements vs inline elements</h3>
        <ul>
          Block elements like <em>&lt;div&gt;</em> create extra stuff like spacing in
          an invisible block around the element. Inline elements, like
          <em>&lt;span&gt;</em>, do not have this effect.
        </ul>
      </P>
    </ul>
